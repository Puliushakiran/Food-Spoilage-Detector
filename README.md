# **Food Spoilage Detector**  

## **Introduction**  
The **Food Spoilage Detector** is a smart system designed to detect food spoilage by monitoring harmful gases like methane and ammonia. The system uses sensors such as **MQ4** and **DHT11** to identify spoilage signs early and alert users via a **buzzer**, **LED**, and **LCD display**. Additionally, the system utilizes the **ESP8266 Wi-Fi module** to send remote alerts, ensuring real-time monitoring and improved food safety.

## **Working Principle**  
The **Food Spoilage Detector** operates as follows:  
1. **Gas Detection:**  
   - The **MQ4** sensor monitors methane and ammonia gas levels.  
2. **Environmental Monitoring:**  
   - The **DHT11** sensor tracks temperature and humidity.  
3. **Alert System:**  
   - If gas concentration exceeds the set threshold, the following actions are triggered:  
     - **Red LED** lights up  
     - **Buzzer** activates  
     - The **LCD display** shows **"Food Spoiled"**  
     - The **ESP8266 Wi-Fi module** sends a notification to the user remotely.  
4. If gas levels remain below the threshold, the system continues monitoring with the **Green LED** active.

## **Setup Instructions**  
Follow these steps to set up the system:  

### **Hardware Setup**  
1. Connect the **MQ4 sensor**, **DHT11 sensor**, and **LCD display** to the **Arduino Uno** as per the block diagram.  
2. Connect the **ESP8266 Wi-Fi module** for remote alerts.  
3. Connect the **LEDs** and **buzzer** to their respective pins.  
4. Use a suitable **power supply** to ensure stable performance.  

### **Software Setup**  
1. Install the **Arduino IDE** on your computer.  
2. Download the required libraries for:  
   - **DHT11 Sensor**  
   - **LiquidCrystal Display**  
   - **ESP8266 Module**  
3. Upload the provided `.ino` file to the **Arduino Uno** board.  
4. Verify and upload the code successfully.

## **Code Explanation**  
- The **MQ4** sensor's analog reading determines the presence of methane gas.  
- The **DHT11** sensor monitors environmental conditions.  
- If gas readings exceed the threshold, the system triggers alerts and displays **"Food Spoiled"**.  
- The **ESP8266** module sends alerts to the userâ€™s device for remote notifications.

## **Testing and Verification**  
1. Power the system and ensure all components are active.  
2. Place a sample of food near the sensors to test the gas detection.  
3. Observe the LCD display, LED indicators, and buzzer behavior for proper functioning.  
4. Ensure remote alerts are successfully transmitted via the **ESP8266** module.

## **Applications**  
ðŸ“Œ **Households:** Prevents accidental consumption of spoiled food.  
ðŸ“Œ **Supermarkets:** Ensures timely removal of spoiled products.  
ðŸ“Œ **Restaurants and Cafeterias:** Helps maintain food quality and hygiene.  
ðŸ“Œ **Cold Storage Units:** Monitors storage conditions to prevent spoilage.  

---

## **Troubleshooting Tips**  
- If the **LCD display** shows random characters, check the wiring and re-upload the code.  
- If the **buzzer** doesnâ€™t sound, verify its connection and ensure the pin is correctly defined in the code.  
- If the **ESP8266** fails to connect, check the Wi-Fi credentials in the code.
